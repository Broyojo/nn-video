# Neural Networks Video Code

## Description
This is the code for the neural networks [video](https://youtu.be/pAqVYPByOZc) located on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@broyojo). It uses the excellent Manim Community Edition library for all animations. 

## How To Run
To install the dependencies, either run `pipenv install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` depending on if you use [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or `pip`.

To generate the video in the same configuration as the YouTube video, run the following command:
```
$ manim -pqh main.py
```
Refer to the [ManimCE documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html) for reference.
